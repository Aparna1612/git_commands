Diffing is a function that takes two input datasets and outputs the changes between them. 
The git diff command is a multi-use Git command which, when executed, runs a diff function on Git data sources. 
These data sources can be commits, branches, files, and more. 
The git diff command is often used along with the git status and git log commands to analyze the current state of our Git repository. 
We use git log to get the details of commit IDs.
